## Master’s Thesis (Ongoing)
**Robust Multilingual Text Summarization for Indian Languages in Low-Resource Settings**

This project investigates transformer-based multilingual approaches for text summarization in low-resource Indian languages, with a focus on robustness and generalization. The work explores cross-lingual transfer and multilingual pretraining to improve summarization quality under data scarcity and distribution shift. Experiments are conducted using pretrained models such as **mT5**, **mBART-50**, and **IndicBART**, with an emphasis on reliability, robustness, and fair evaluation across languages including Hindi, Gujarati, and Bengali.

## Bachelor’s Thesis
**IoT-HITS: IoT-based Human Intrusion Detection System for Border Regions Using Deep Learning**

This project focused on designing an IoT-enabled border security system for real-time human intrusion detection. It involved developing a deep learning–based detection pipeline integrated with IoT sensors to monitor restricted regions and trigger alerts upon detecting unauthorized intrusions. The system emphasized reliability, real-time performance, and deployment feasibility in resource-constrained environments.

## Additional Projects
**Text Classification Using TF–IDF Feature Extraction**

Developed a text classification system using TF–IDF-based feature extraction and classical machine learning algorithms. The project included comprehensive text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization, and focused on evaluating generalization performance across document categories.
