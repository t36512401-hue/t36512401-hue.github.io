<br>

I am a research and currently working on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**; with a focus on building **reliable and trustworthy language models**. I am concerned with the interaction between AI systems and actual individuals as well as authentic information. I want to develop methodologies and assessment techniques that more accurately represent varied users and applications.

My master’s thesis on **robust multilingual text summarization for Indian languages in low-resource settings**, focusing on transformer-based models and their generalization and reliability under data scarcity and distribution shift.
