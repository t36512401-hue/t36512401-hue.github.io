<br>
I am a researcher working on **robust and fairness-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a focus on building **reliable and trustworthy language models**. My research interests include:

- Adversarial robustness  
- Distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization  
- Multilingual NLP and low-resource languages  
- Uncertainty estimation and calibration  
- Reliable evaluation of LLM-based systems  

My work aims to understand model failure modes under real-world conditions and to develop methods that improve robustness, fairness, and generalization.

### 🎓 Master’s Thesis
**Robust Multilingual Text Summarization for Indian Languages in Low-Resource Settings**  
*(M.Tech in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, IIIT Ranchi)*

My master’s thesis focuses on developing **robust transformer-based multilingual summarization models** for **low-resource Indian languages**. The work investigates:

- Multilingual and cross-lingual transfer for summarization  
- Robustness under data scarcity and distribution shift  
- Evaluation reliability across Hindi, Gujarati, and Bengali  
- Pretrained multilingual models such as **mT5, mBART-50, and IndicBART**  

The goal is to improve **generalization, robustness, and fairness** of summarization systems in real-world multilingual settings.
