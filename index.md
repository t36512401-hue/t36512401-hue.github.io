## About Me

I am a researcher working on **robust and fairness-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a focus on building **reliable and trustworthy language models**. My research interests include:

- Adversarial robustness  
- Distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization  
- Multilingual NLP and low-resource languages  
- Uncertainty estimation and calibration  
- Reliable evaluation of LLM-based systems  

My work aims to understand model failure modes under real-world conditions and to develop methods that improve robustness, fairness, and generalization.

I am currently pursuing an **M.Tech in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Ranchi**.
