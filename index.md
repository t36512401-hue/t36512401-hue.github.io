<br>
I am a researcher working on **robust and fairness-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a focus on building **reliable and trustworthy language models**. My research interests include adversarial robustness, distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization, multilingual NLP for low-resource languages, uncertainty estimation, and reliable evaluation of LLM-based systems. My work aims to understand model failure modes under real-world conditions and to develop methods that improve robustness, fairness, and generalization.

I am currently working on a master’s thesis on **robust multilingual text summarization for Indian languages in low-resource settings**, focusing on transformer-based models and their generalization and reliability under data scarcity and distribution shift.
